The CSH DALEKS Project
	Driveable Automated Landscape Exploring Kinematic System

Explaniation of file layout:
	icreatepyrobot.py:
		This file contains the roomba python api. It exposes the low level 
		controls for the roomba.
		hxRoomba.py sits on top of this to provide the DALEKS api
	hxRoomba.py:
		1 layer above the icreatepyrobot api. Acts as a middle man between 
		the servers and the roomba api.
		The roomba controller which is the basic api class used to control 
		the roomba
	restfulRoomba.py:
		Contains one of the 2 server classes. This one being a restful api 
		server. The api server sits on top of the hxRoomba api class, 
		and lets remote users interact with the roomba
	xmlrpcRoomba.py:
		Contains the second server class. The xmlrpc api server.
		This is an older and slower api server which was pretty much 
		deprecated when the rest server start working.
		(Warning, here be lag)
	xmlrpcServer.py:
		This does no contain a server, however it does allow you 
		to start an xmlrpc server
	restClient.py:
		Contains a client that connects to the roomba via the 
		restful api. This client class exposes the same methods 
		as the class in hxRoomba.
	rShell.py:
		A Command line iterface to the roomba allowing for control 
		via text commands.
